After just about getting it working, I put on my nastiest old trainers and carried the whole thing plus my inflated inner tube down to the subway. Just as I was starting, a cyclist appeared, wondering if he could get through. I warned him I had tried yesterday and it had endhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_lulLSQ8UYed badly. He asked, is that a science experiment? No, I replied, more like an art experiment. He stayed to watch me wade a little way into the tunnel with the floating Randomatone, trying not to drop my phone in the water.<br/><br/>I learned a few things doing this: 1) The sound was not nearly loud enough to resonate in the tunnel acoustic. The volume was not set to maximum, even then I'm wondering if it would have been enough. 2) I'm glad I used polypropylene speakers, even if they were a bit small, as they caught a lot of rain. 3) Amazingly the electronics survived, despite being completely exposed, though I will not do this again without putting them in a plastic enclosure. 4) The water felt moderately warm after I'd been in it for a few minutes."

Biggest surprise was the south tunnel under the Waterworks Roundabout, knee deep in water, as I found out when I tried to cycle through it. Later I wondered whether I should go straight ahead and build a randomatone frame for the half of one of 25l bottles. Then I remembered I had bought an inner tube weeks ago exactly for this purpose, and could probably get the single diamond one up and running faster."

Batteries lasted a good few hours despite their age, though the unit with the Model B Raspberry Pi (which consumes more power than the Model A+ versions on the other units) ran down much quicker and died. Maybe I'll need the massive golf-buggy 20Ah batteries next time, as not only are those more beefy, they are new.<br/><br/>The sound was fairly lush, though there were some technical issues with the audio not ramping up or panning properly, for which I have a plan B. Even just on the stairs there wasn't a lot of spacial definition, ie sounds that discernably come from one place or another. I realise now that the nature of the sounds, which ramp up and slowly back down in volume, probably do not lend themselves to directionality, whereas more percussive sounds might. Something to try later.<br/><br/> As a listening experience it was soothing and not at all irksome even after having it playing round the house for many hours. After turning it all off, I still heard the sounds playing in my head, like seeing residual auras of colour when the lights go out. Just as unsingable, too."

At 25 litres, each would provide easily buoyancy I need for a Randomatone, even cut in half into miniature barges. These are by no means ideal, as I really want something round, or with a high degree of rotational symmetry, as I want to rotate them in the water while keeping them tethered."

        text: "Test assembly already weighing in excess of 4Kg. The plan was to attach large bottles perpendicularly to the three joists just before they converge at the base. Utter failure. The flimsy 2l milk bottles buckled as soon as they hit the water and the centre of gravity was far too high. I should probably be learning some fluid mechanics if I really want a go at this. My first thought was to seat the unit in an inner tube of a car tyre. I have one ready to try. However, I am still clinging to the idea of using bottles, this time facing downwards and running along the lower joists rather than perpendicular to them. Plus I have a fallback plan if I really want to make floating Randomatones, but it will involve a different frame."

The other two are similar, but each unit has a different combination of speaker sizes for individuality. The plan is to position the multiple units in separate parts of the room, but I actually quite like the way these units look clustered together. It makes me thing the speaker positioning should be random, rather than regular and predictable as they are here. Next task is to take the speakers off, put other bits of wood on for mounting the electronics later, then sand and paint in bright colours. Because why not."

Target is three for now, for which I will see if I can arrange some kind of showing in London. Maybe get a video together first. It strikes me the audio should be a field recording. It will be almost impossible to capture the ambient sound distribution from having three (nevermind several) of these positioned around a room, and a normal stereo recording is going to sound too perfect an impression of the wrong thing. One idea I had is to mount a couple of tiny mics onto each unit and let each make its own room/field recording from its perspective, then mix those in the stereo image depending on where the camera is pointing."

        text: "An eventful week of blowing up a Raspberry Pi and an amp. Tried a new smaller RPi (model A+) and found it had some glitches, but these could be reproduced simply by adjusting the system volume, so I'm not confident about the analogue output. Needing replacement amp as well I went for a HifiBerry Pi \"hat\", which is entirely digital and will thus bypass all the RPi audio bits which I think are the issue. Also, brilliantly, it takes 12V but will do the step down to 5V itself for the RPi. This will save me having to have an extra unit with wiring issues. Tried it all out after the necessary config changes in the RPi to tell it where its audio has to go. Not only does everything work, the audio is basically clean. Needs a volume control though, without a keybaord or a mouse. Hmm! In a totally unrelated flight of consciousness, I have begun pursuing the crazy idea of making a set of these units that will float. This would be the basic chassis, and one way of making it float might be to use the inner tube of a car tyre. So I've ordered one. I might work on this frame idea a bit more. I'm pleased with my elementary woodworking skills to have made this item, which at least looks like it fits together."

Tried the sound generator, essentially everything works, with some issues. Audio playback has glitches, and there is a lot of interference noise. One issue might be the 12V-5V converter, as I've heard this kind of noise before when combining audio signals from things with different switch mode PSUs. Anyway I tried a USB audio interface just to rule out the RPi onboard DAC. Slightly quieter. Reduced noise significantly by not using 12v-5v stepdown, instead powering the RPi from a regular mains PSU. Got noise at all running it from two separate batteries. Joining the battery grounds made a load of noise reappear. Joining the +ves also made noise appear. Tried a different 12V-5V converter from the car, same result."

I've been preparing the software for this for some time now and had it working on a regular linux machine, and have tried it out on the RPi by itself over Wifi, not in this assembly yet."
