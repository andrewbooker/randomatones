I took a canal trip a couple of summers ago, part of which was a day on a section of the Birmingham network. I didn't pass through this stretch of waterway, but the trip definitely left an impression, though not entirely a good one at the time.<br/><br/>The combination of water, enclosed spaces with rich acoustics, and simple ambient music is a serene one for me, and one I intend to explore much more deeply. I live in London, which has a canal network, but nothing like Birmingham, whose centuries-old waterway architecture seems largely untouched despite modern redevelopments all around it. And unlike London, it has tunnels you can walk through.<br/><br/>Also I very much prefer ducks and geese to pigeons.</div>

In the event, the pigeons provided an interesting few seconds of rotating filth, as I placed a camera on the underside of the blue unit to capture a whirling view of the unit and the ground below, in which their droppings produced a kind of blurry rotating starscape (watch from 0:57 for 10 seconds to see what I mean).<br/><br/>Passers-by came and went in step with train arrivals, and many turned their heads.<br/><br/> In general this was a fine location, a handsome Victorian arch providing a pedestrian walkway next to Pudding Mill Lane station, with the recent modern concrete Crossrail addition for contrast. Relatively quiet, but perhaps too vast for the small units. The larger horns would have made more of a sonic impact.</div>

A reversible polarity setup would require an H-bridge arrangement. For a while I had no plans to implement this, as the varying speeds of the motors was enough to suggest rotational chaos. This was empahsised for me when one day I made the red unit rotate in the opposite direction (for a shoot last month). I found with the units rotating counter to each other, the variations in their speed were unnoticeable.</div>

The floodwater is muddy, which I don't like. And although I would have no problem wading in here, as it's probably only 15-20cm deep, I would create waves which would spoil the stillness if I were to use floating units. Having incorrect shoes at the time of visiting, I didn't go in to see how quiet it was, but outside, the M25 above was incredibly noisy. Nothing to stop me making a decent video with just the direct sound from the units, but it would be nice to hear how they sound in that acoustic, which given this is a concrete casing, should be very good. Also it's lit, which is a bonus. Sadly no graffiti though.</div>

              <div class="post-text">This is a location I considered some time ago, and though I knew it could not possibly compete with the Woolwich Foot Tunnel, I set up here anyway purely to tick it off the list. It turned out to be a great setting.<br/><br/>The acoustic was flattering and the colours were surprising, with the ochre brickwork almost aglow. Most appealing when I look back at the video was the reflective concrete ceiling. Just as people preoccupied with videoing a situation scarcely notice what's around them, I barely noticed it at the time.<br/><br>I had been working on the sounds and by this point had introduced occasional octave sweeps. I did wonder whether these might be a little extreme and disturbing to the many depot workers entering and exiting their site, perhaps worrying them that one of their buildings might be on fire. In the end some last minute scaling down of the effect was worthwhile. The sound on the shoot was excellent, though it comes across less well and was generally too quiet in the recording, compared to the roaring of trains passing overhead, and the depot workers unloading a massive digger off a low-loader nearby.<br/><br/>If you're wondering how that activity did not appear in my usual walk-towards and walk-away shots, it's because I did those on the previous day. I did all the setup, switched on, and found that the units did not turn. I had broken something while fiddling with the octave sweeps.</div>

It also demonstrates how chronic noise pollution can be ameliorated, here forming an integral part of an ambient music piece.<br/><br/>I was very anxious about this shoot. CCTV camera pods every 50 paces, drunks yelling from one end to the other, generally being in the way of people and fast cyclists. Least of all was that the alarm, which I had recorded and set the Randomatones to play in their key, would have stopped or changed to something in the wrong key. My worst fear was one of the supports coming off and the unit falling on someone's head. That’s assuming I got the supports the right length. Too short and I would not be able to hook onto the pipes, too long and people would be hitting their heads on them.<br/><br/>Nothing of the kind went wrong. The supports were perfect. The units sounded stunning and fitted perfectly with the alarm that was still sounding 10 days after I last heard it. For six blissful minutes I wondered around videoing from various angles thinking "this is beautiful."<br/><br/>Not everything went smoothly. I had tried and tested small suction cups to stick on the tiled walls for mouting my camera (phone) and my Zoom audio recorder. On the day, the cups immediately fell off, and that was without anything attached to them, luckily. Most of the still shots I did with my phone on a gooseneck stand clamped to my cycling helmet.</div>

All surfaces are concrete, including the footpath, meaning the acoustic in the middle is excellent. The railings are perfect for hanging Randomatones from, and the water right now looks only a couple of inches deep, allowing paddling around with a tripod if desired. Even the walls have graffiti, though it's hard to see as there is no lighting inside. I will need to adorn each of the rotating units with another 10W or so of LED lighting.<br/><br/>I may not use this one, as it is a car journey from where I live (South Woodford) and I believe there is a similar specimen nearer to home that I aim to check out soon.</div>

That will be the end of pacing over to shoots with just a rucksack<br/>br/>I thought I had made a mistake here, as when the new horns arrived they were clearly 100V line devices, which would have been no use. Luckily, take the back off and you find inside there is simply a transformer to convert the ordinary low impedance magnet/coil driver to 100V line. Simply remove this transformer and the speaker is good to go. It's also at least 0.5Kg lighter.</div>

This location, on the river Roding just north of the Redbridge roundabout in East London, is all of that, and had exactly the look I wanted. But it was far too noisy to make a meaningful video demonstrating the sonic delights of the Randomatones. Of course it would be noisy, I should have known that. The time I first considered it as a location was summer 2020, when possibly fewer people were rushing up and down the North Circular and it was quieter. I don't remember.<br/><br>Anyway I'm reasonably pleased with the look of this video, if the sound does have to come direct from the units, and not from microphones that just picked up traffic noise. I think I need bigger units. Once again these looked tiny in their vast concrete arena. But they are still fun to capture close-up, and I risk boring even myself if I follow through with plans for several more videos like this.</div>

I knew this was a risk, and spent some time tuning the motors so that each of the discrete speeds the motors ran was in tune and in key with the notes from the Randomatones. The motors are driven from a pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi (via a couple of power transistors), and I achieved the tuning by selecting the appropriate width and pulse of the PWM. This sounded convincing indoors. Outside, all you can hear is a tuneless whining buzz like an electric shaver.<br/><br/>One of the things that attracted me to this location was the ledge on either side of the thoroughfare on which I could set up the units without being in the way of passers-by. Having only ever biked along it, I did not realise until I got there for the video that the ledge was above my head height. I insist on showing you how bad I was at climbing up onto it. I must have done so at least 12 times during the shoot. Sadly practice made no perfection, instead I got worse and worse at it.</div>

              <div class="post-text">Back after several months away with a prototype hanging spinning Randomatone. This one has a 40 RPM geared motor whose speed is varied using one of the PWM ports on the Rasperry Pi. The motor mechanism issues its own clearly audible whine, but by using some combination of PWM voltage and frequency, I am wondering if I could tune the motor to the Randomatone notes. I want variable speed, so that several together will all rotate differently and chaotically, but I would be happy with them shifting between discrete speeds rather than varying continuously as now.<br/><br/>Also note the introduction of a cheap plastic horn speaker. Compared to the other more hi-fi cardboard cone speaker, its sound quality is poor, but the squawky mid-range of the horn does suit some of the rougher waveforms the unit generates. It's also lighter and more weatherproof than the card-cone speaker. Not that I plan to hang these from trees or lamp posts just yet.<br/><br/>I will probably rethink the decorative red and blue LEDs. It looks like a kind of weird megaphone, but when I watch the thing spinning I think of a siren on a police car or fire engine. A Sirenatone. (I doubt I will call it that for long.)</div>

Unlike in the previous video, the positioning of the units along the ceiling line goes some way towards explaining their shape. I had planned to put one device under each tunnel section, but the ceiling was higher in the north tunnel and I found I could not reach it. At least this time I had the volume good and loud, and the units properly sang through the walkway. A lot of the ambient audio in this video was picked up by the mic on each unit.</div>

Did you leave them there?" No way, I thought, there's £100 of gear on each one at least! But then I thought, if this is supposed to be art, I should be aiming to do exactly that. What could I change that would make me comfortable leaving something there for, say, a day?<br/><br/>Leaving expendable stuff, is what. No Raspberry Pi/HifiBerry units, no £20 speakers (though £20 for a speaker is very cheap) and no brand new batteries. Whereupon, various bits of old junk I had in the study or the shed came to mind. I have no recollection what piece of kit this amp came from, but electronics with crazy printed circuit boards like that I reckon are from the 1970s. So, naturally, it all still worked. I soldered up some power leads where I thought the 12V supply should go, plus two speakers from an old TV (15W each, surprisingly), and a 3.5mm stereo jack to the input. Then dug out an old unloved mp3 player and plugged in. Even with those puny speakers it was pretty loud, though I know loudness in the home is on a different scale to loudness in the outdoors. This will not be a true randomatone, as it will have to play a recording. But as the real units are not yet interactive, I can load an hour of sounds on an mp3 to play in a loop, and the effect will be the same. Random ambient music for dog walkers.</div>

Also an excuse to get started on some simple pitch shifting of samples, of which I intend to make much more use later. Purely for the spooks I used a chromatic note generation scheme instead of a conventional minor or major key, and stuck to sine waves. It turned out no more scary than a 1950s B-moving where the aliens have landed, in fact I prefer it. The notes arrive too slowly to clash, and there is a sense of freedom to it.<br/><br/>On the soundtrack, the bangs in the background are genuine, and I have little idea where they came from. But like serendipitous moments that happen when improvising music, they work brilliantly as an impromptu percussion accompaniment to the eerie space-calls from the two bug-eye speakers.</div>

But in the rush to video something before the water drained away, I was ill-prepared with mics, the unit was too quiet and there was too much traffic noise.<br/><br/>Instead, what came out of this opportune shoot was a unique perspective on two semi-submerged murals of tunnel graffiti that I would normally never look at, at least not while looking where I was going. The wide-angle camera gets further away than the eye ordinarily can, and its view close to the waterline as it makes its way through the tunnel is striking. While I’m not generally a fan of spray-painting Victorian brickwork in fluorescent colours, in an ugly featureless concrete people-conduit like this, I begin to see the graffiti as modern example of the way people have been expressing themselves on walls for millennia, like 21st century cave paintings.</div>

After just about getting it working, I put on my nastiest old trainers and carried the whole thing plus my inflated inner tube down to the subway. Just as I was starting, a cyclist appeared, wondering if he could get through. I warned him I had tried yesterday and it had ended badly. He asked, is that a science experiment? No, I replied, more like an art experiment. He stayed to watch me wade a little way into the tunnel with the floating Randomatone, trying not to drop my phone in the water.<br/><br/>I learned a few things doing this: 1) The sound was not nearly loud enough to resonate in the tunnel acoustic. The volume was not set to maximum, even then I'm wondering if it would have been enough. 2) I'm glad I used polypropylene speakers, even if they were a bit small, as they caught a lot of rain. 3) Amazingly the electronics survived, despite being completely exposed, though I will not do this again without putting them in a plastic enclosure. 4) The water felt moderately warm after I'd been in it for a few minutes.</div>

Batteries lasted a good few hours despite their age, though the unit with the Model B Raspberry Pi (which consumes more power than the Model A+ versions on the other units) ran down much quicker and died. Maybe I'll need the massive golf-buggy 20Ah batteries next time, as not only are those more beefy, they are new.<br/><br/>The sound was fairly lush, though there were some technical issues with the audio not ramping up or panning properly, for which I have a plan B. Even just on the stairs there wasn't a lot of spacial definition, ie sounds that discernably come from one place or another. I realise now that the nature of the sounds, which ramp up and slowly back down in volume, probably do not lend themselves to directionality, whereas more percussive sounds might. Something to try later.<br/><br/> As a listening experience it was soothing and not at all irksome even after having it playing round the house for many hours. After turning it all off, I still heard the sounds playing in my head, like seeing residual auras of colour when the lights go out. Just as unsingable, too.</div>

I should probably be learning some fluid mechanics if I really want a go at this. My first thought was to seat the unit in an inner tube of a car tyre. I have one ready to try. However, I am still clinging to the idea of using bottles, this time facing downwards and running along the lower joists rather than perpendicular to them.

It will be almost impossible to capture the ambient sound distribution from having three (nevermind several) of these positioned around a room, and a normal stereo recording is going to sound too perfect an impression of the wrong thing. One idea I had is to mount a couple of tiny mics onto each unit and let each make its own room/field recording from its perspective, then mix those in the stereo image depending on where the camera is pointing.</div>

Tried a new smaller RPi (model A+) and found it had some glitches, but these could be reproduced simply by adjusting the system volume, so I'm not confident about the analogue output. Needing a replacement amp as well I went for a HifiBerry Pi "hat", which is entirely digital and will thus bypass all the RPi audio bits which I think are the issue. Also, brilliantly, it takes 12V but will do the step down to 5V itself for the RPi. This will save me having to have an extra unit with wiring issues. Tried it all out after the necessary config changes in the RPi to tell it where its audio has to go. Not only does everything work, the audio is basically clean. Needs a volume control though, without a keybaord or a mouse. Hmm! In a totally unrelated flight of consciousness, I have begun pursuing the crazy idea of making a set of these units that will float. This would be the basic chassis, and one way of making it float might be to use the inner tube of a car tyre. So I've ordered one. I might work on this frame idea a bit more. I'm pleased with my elementary woodworking skills to have made this item, which at least looks like it fits together.</div>

This little-used subway has a terrific acoustic and would otherwise be a prime candidate for recording some Randomatones. Sigh.</div>

              <div class="post-text">The prototype again, reconstructed with only three vertical posts, as I realised the fourth was unnecessary and in the way. Tried the sound generator, essentially everything works, with some issues. Audio playback has glitches, and there is a lot of interference noise. One issue might be the 12V-5V converter, as I've heard this kind of noise before when combining audio signals from things with different switch mode PSUs. Anyway I tried a USB audio interface just to rule out the RPi onboard DAC. Slightly quieter. Reduced noise significantly by not using 12v-5v stepdown, instead powering the RPi from a regular mains PSU. Got noise at all running it from two separate batteries. Joining the battery grounds made a load of noise reappear. Joining the +ves also made noise appear. Tried a different 12V-5V converter from the car, same result.</div>

              <div class="post-text">Assembled prototype. You can just see that behind the circuit boards is a massive 12V 20Ah battery, the kind you find in a mobility scooter. This powers the Raspberry Pi via a step-down to 5V, and a 2x20W amp, currently driving two cheap speakers from Halfords. I've been preparing the software for this for some time now and had it working on a regular linux machine, and have tried it out on the RPi by itself over Wifi, not in this assembly yet.</div>
