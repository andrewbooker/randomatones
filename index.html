Fortunately for me, at 8am on a rainy Sunday morning in March, there weren't even any of those, and I had the place to myself. Besides some slight camera issues, and general taking an eternity to get set up, this was an exemplary shoot. I got the units in the water undercover. I was expecting the water level to be much lower, but the amount of recent rain had raised it to the point I was able reach it from under the bridge. It had also given it a noticeable current, meaning once I had dragged them to the other end, they floated downstream perfectly over 10 or so graceful and sublime minutes.<br/><br/>Having not been able to shut the pink unit down properly at the end of yesterday's shoot, it was still playing in its previous key, whereas I had reset the blue one to play in a different key. They sounded fantastic together.</div>

Great location, no wind, no rain (until I emerged), no leaks, no boats, with somewhere I could park my car nearby. Minor technical issues on this one, for some reason the pink unit wouldn't start its audio processing automatically, and needed me to press the manual override button I had very cleverly added to the units a few weeks before, having wished I had one on several shoots in the past.<br/><br>I was in slightly better control of my boat this time. As I sat in it, drifting on the slight current into the middle of the tunnel, I savoured this stunning sight and sound of the two units against the backdrop of the south portal, spoilt only by something pokey in my rucksack digging into my back as I sat against it.</div>

              <div class="post-text">On the way up to a gig in Manchester a few weeks ago, I stopped at this tunnel on the Grand Union Canal in Warwickshire. I had been through it on a canal boat trip in 2020, but remembered only the imposing western entrance (seen here at the beginning of the video) and nothing else about it. I didn’t remember that it had water pouring in through the roof everywhere, as was the case on the day I turned up. It had been raining up and down the country, so I assumed this was the reason. In fact the tunnel always leaks, giving rise to many flowstone formations inside. I didn’t see much of that on the day, as I did not venture in past an enormous cascade maybe 20m in from the entrance, which would have wrecked my non-waterproof devices.</div>

Fearful of the currents, I tethered the recording unit to the side, while it joined up with the sound-making units via a new V-shaped connecting rod setup made from thin, lightweight and very expensive aluminium L-beams. Feeling after 10 mins or so that I got quite a nice shoot out of it, I decided to stop videoing, take a couple of stills, and just enjoy the sight and sound for a few minutes, something I almost never (get to) do on a shoot, and yet which is the whole idea of this sonic art project. I managed a couple of minutes, before I realised the tether had come undone, and my fragile devices where about to get swept into the lock.</div>

That ruled out videoing in this location, partly because of the roar of the temporary lock-gate waterfall, but mainly because of the turbulence. For a Randomatone video, I want stillness.</div>

              <div class="post-text">A couple of things have dissatisfied me about floating Randomatone video shoots in the past. One is that I've seledom been able to get a good audio recording. The floating units have onboard mics, but those are too close, and capture too much mechanical noise from propellors etc, and not enough ambient sound from the location. Another is that I've not been able to get decent close-up video of the units while still capturing the location. I can get close-up video from towpaths in tunnels, but video from one tunnel tends to look like video from any other, and I could be anywhere.<br/><br/>So this is an experimental third unit that I wanted to put together using as much equipment as I had already, without spending much money. The only things I invested in were windjammers and shock-proof mounts for my two Rode NT5 microphones, and a stereo USB mixer with two phantom-powered XLR inputs. I powered the mixer from a small 9V battery via a 7805 voltage regulator I scavenged from some other old equipment I taken to bits. The video is captured via my trusty old LG G5 phone, plus a higher wide-angle view from the small action camera that also doubles as the Wifi hub. The same 5V supply can power those two devices if necessary. Sadly it seems like the G5, despite its newer USB-C connection (unusual in 2017 when I bought it) doesn't recognise the USB mixer as a stereo audio source for its video. No matter, it has its own mics, and I record the Rode NT5s on a separate Zoom digital recorder at the bottom of the float. The whole thing sits in a black plastic enclosure that came off an old car vacuum cleaner, which I thought I was only keeping for the motor. Funny how things are useful. The black enclosure exactly fits the middle of the silver swim ring.</div>

              <div class="post-text">Earlier this year I started buying bits to build two new floating Randomatones. Normally when I build new Randomatones I cannibalise the old ones for the expensive parts (Raspberry Pi, HifiBerry amp). The current set of three floating ones, the blue, pink and orange units, have done very well and I have taken them out many times, and I want to keep them.<br/><br/>They are also pretty large, and I want some smaller ones with which I can be more mobile. At one time I had two small spinning versions that could both fit into my rucksack, meaning I could get them to places in London on my bike. They were too small to be visually that interesting within a location, and I could not get them loud enough without distorting the speakers. The current floating ones are loud enough and big enough, but a bit too big to carry around easily. I want something in between. And because I'm favouring watery locations such as canal tunnels, there is the frequent risk of rain falling on them, so I want the new units to be water-resisant.<br/><br/>The picture shows some of the parts for one new Randomatone. I'm sticking with the same model Rasberry Pi for now. There are other varieties of small Single Board Computer I could try, but being able to stick on the HifiBerry amp hat to it makes me inclined to stick with the Raspberry Pi for now. New ones were impossible to find last year thanks to the global chip shortage, and when I finally managed to bag two more, the price had doubled.<br/><br>Each new device will have two plastic horn speakers for one channel, and two waterproof plastic cone speakers on the other (or I might try one of each per channel). Doubling up the speakers means they will shift more air, and wired in parallel will get the most power out of the amp in terms of impedance matching. Between the speakers in the picture is a waterproof case. I've not bothered with one of these before, but I think it's time. The blue item below the case is a new battery. This is 14.8V 5.2Ah lithimn ion battery, more powerful than the 12V lead acid batteries I've been using, and a lot lighter. Below that is a different variety of propellor motor (with an H-bridge in its plastic wrapping). The previous ones worked OK initially but soon started to sieze up either with rust or other dirt. Possibly lack of maintenance on my part, but I'm going for a different brand here just in case it's an improvement.</div>

              <div class="post-text">The Randomatones in their creepiest location yet. I'm thinking that for the next several outings I'll be sticking to canals that are still in use, with tunnels you can actually walk through on a path, before I venture into many more locations like this. But the Randomatones looked and sounded stunning in here.<br/><br/>Stupidly, my failure to ensure a certain battery was properly charged meant that I lost wifi connection to the units fairly early on, which meant I could not direct them back towards my position in the shallow water of the entrance, meaning I had to stray into the tunnel to get them. I do not recommend you do this. The tunnel owners have not asked me to say this, I'm just relating my own experience that the tunnel floor is muddy, I nearly got stuck in it a few times, and had I fallen over and got my hands stuck too, that could have been the end of yours truly. So I repeat, if you fancy striding in yourself, I do not recommend you do.<br/><br/>The immediate consequence was that wading in up to my thighs created turbulence of the surface, disturbing the stillness of the water that I like so much, and if I could expect from any location, it would be here. Also I created mud clouds, spoiling the otherwise pristine clarity of the water. On the plus side, wading in meant I got some good video looking out into the daylight, wishing I was standing there. Apart from that, from the gothic entrance, into the undisturbed brick time-capsule of this abandoned water conduit, this could have been their finest setting.<br/><br/>The tunnel's wikipedia page suggests the Cotswolds Canal Trust at one time conducted boat tours into this tunnel, presumably from the other end near Coates where the tunnel casing is considered safe (I entered though the northern Daneway portal, which the CCT consider not safe). They don't advertise them, and perhaps never did any, and have instead only carried out private surveys. But supposing they did, maybe a little sonic art installation like this would enhance the trip.</div>

I had avoided this kind of location in the past partly out of fear, and partly because I was not yet satisfied I could make a video in complete darkness. That is still somewhat true, but with some additional lights on the connecting rod, powered by a nice new small but powerful 9V rechargable battery, I felt I was just about ready to try this location, given that I would be passing by.<br/><br/>From pictures online, I surmised the water in the tunnel would be several inches deep, and I might need a new pair of Wellington boots, so I went to buy some before setting out. The one size the shop had none of was mine. No matter, when I waded into the tunnel, the water came up to the top of my thighs.</div>

As the family in front of us went through on their boat, the younger ones started whooping and singing, making the most of the massive reverb in the tunnel. Perfect Randomatones territory.<br/><br/>When I returned one Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago, the tunnel was every bit as special as I remembered it. There was almost no wind, and the most of the time no boats, so the water was like a mirror. One technical issue got in the way. The forward/reverse propellor motor on the blue unit had siezed. I was prepared for this, with pliers and oil, and I managed to make it go, but only with it emitting a loud screech as it turned. I thought the din might not be so bad underwater, but the muffled squegging was still audible. I left it in most of the video soundtrack, for honesty.<br/><br/>After a while I got fed up with the noise and turned all the motors off, whereupon I was treated to a sublime and mesmerising sound and light show as they drifted very slowly downstream in the slight current. I left mostly elated, except for the small part of me that wished I had shot the whole thing that way.</div>

This is me approaching the eastern portal through the mud, through Spring has definitely arrived at this point, and the peace and quiet of the canal is decorated with an abundance of birdsong.<br/><br/>It struck me as I was videoing in the tunnel that I had possibly never heard birdsong with a huge reverb applied to it. We almost always here it in the open air with no reverberation, likewise when used as a sound effect, or featuring in a field (literally) recording. However, stand a little way into a 189m brick-lined tunnel sunk into a wooded hill, and you witness plenty of this semi-natural phenomenon.</div>

Leaving the bustle of the main road, down a winding path, you descend to a different world. This tunnel is one of a kind in London. London has two other longer tunnels, on this same canal, but you cannot walk through them, while this one is relatively short (48m) and has a towpath with railings. It can only be accessed during the day, as its section of the towpath lies within a private mooring that is closed off to the public overnight.<br/><br/>By day, the Regents Canal path is a well-trodden walking route, so there were a few spectators on this shoot. I did a not very good job of keeping out of their way, and stayed as long as I could, until the tether got caught up in one of the propellors (that’s happened twice now). By chance that was all the time I had anyway, between the to-and-fro of a sightseeing narrowboat. You can see it passing downstream as I blow up one of the floats, and just as I got the devices out of the water, it returned.</div>

One day I will trust the piloting abilities of the blue unit, which has two propellors for forward/reverse and rotational movement (the pink unit has one propellor, for rotation only). However, on the evening, the blue unit motors where playing up, or possibly not running fast enough.<br/><br/>Also on this one I had problems with floats, and had to blow up three before I had a couple that I thought I could trust. I was mistaken, as the air nozzle cover of the blue unit float popped out early on, causing it to slowly deflate through the video.</div>

Certain aspects did not surprise me, such as how cold the water was.<br/><br/>Normally I like graffiti in a concrete tunnel like this, but on the riverside section of wall there was nothing, and little on the path side either, leaving the starkly lit bare concrete, which was appealing in its own way.</div>

However, there is good shelter from wind, and there is practically zero current, so the water has a glassy stillness. On top of all that, the fluorescent lighting is stunning, making this a perfect spot for an early evening installation.</div>

The acoustic is cavernous, and the curved walkway is lit at water level, and although not to everyone's taste, there is some colourful graffiti along the wall. The downside is that there tends to be a significant draft down-river, in the same direction as the current, meaning controlling two flimsy floats was bound to be precarious. In the end I didn't have the courage to let then units drift away, despite having spent some development time on the propellor controls, as I wasn't confident they had enough power against the wind and the current. But it was a good test of my two-camera setup on the connecting rods.</div>

Most of this was countryside, but part of it went through the eastern edge of Birmingham. The environment was a bit on the gritty side, and the waterways were a shockingly polluted soup of all kinds of household waste. But in general I found the canal architecture hugely appealing, especially this fine example just south of the Tyburn Road (A38) in Erdington, where the canal passes under a derelict factory that once made electric furnaces.<br/><br/>As we drifted slowly underneath, I felt had to come back to this place for some artistic reason or other. I was so enthralled with it, I crashed the boat into the bridge at the other end.<br/><br/>Two years later, on my way back from a band rehearsal in Stoke-on-Trent with two floating Randomatones in the car, I returned to this place to record them moving about in the water at random, and playing their randomised glow-in-the-dark concert of varispeed arpeggios to the empty resonant space of this covered section of canal.</div>

Conditions for this shoot were pretty good, the water was glassy smooth, and there seemed to be very little breeze. Then I got the units in the water, and after first nearly disappearing down the overflow, they blew off upstream under the bridge, where I wanted them, but then kept going. I had not had a chance to properly get used to the remote controls for the propellor onboard the blue unit, nor did it seem powerful enough to counter the upstream wind. I thought I was going to lose them on their first outing.<br/><br>I really like the way they looked and sounded though. The sound featured the new arpeggiation I had been working on (trivial compared with having to fit remote-controllable propellors) and was fantastic under the bridge. Visually the units were striking in their vibrant colours, and the searchlight glare of the LED spot lights on each unit played beautifully over the clean brickwork. When pointing at the camera they were a bit intense, but for now my plan is to improve and increase the rotation of the units, so that the glare is only ever fleeting.<br/><br>In all, a decent first trip out and very promising.</div>

              <div class="post-text">Made on a rainy Sunday morning before I was due at a midday rehearsal near Tardebigge. I took a canal trip a couple of summers ago, part of which was a day on a section of the Birmingham network. I didn't pass through this stretch of waterway, but the trip definitely left an impression, though not entirely a good one at the time.<br/><br/>The combination of water, enclosed spaces with rich acoustics, and simple ambient music is a serene one for me, and one I intend to explore much more deeply. I live in London, which has a canal network, but nothing like Birmingham, whose centuries-old waterway architecture seems largely untouched despite modern redevelopments all around it. And unlike London, it has tunnels you can walk through.<br/><br/>Also I very much prefer ducks and geese to pigeons.</div>

Relatively quiet, but perhaps too vast for the small units. The larger horns would have made more of a sonic impact.</div>

Having incorrect shoes at the time of visiting, I didn't go in to see how quiet it was, but outside, the M25 above was incredibly noisy. Nothing to stop me making a decent video with just the direct sound from the units, but it would be nice to hear how they sound in that acoustic, which given this is a concrete casing, should be very good. Also it's lit, which is a bonus. Sadly no graffiti though.</div>

It turned out to be a great setting.<br/><br/>The acoustic was flattering and the colours were surprising, with the ochre brickwork almost aglow. Most appealing when I look back at the video was the reflective concrete ceiling. Just as people preoccupied with videoing a situation scarcely notice what's around them, I barely noticed it at the time.<br/><br>I had been working on the sounds and by this point had introduced occasional octave sweeps. I did wonder whether these might be a little extreme and disturbing to the many depot workers entering and exiting their site, perhaps worrying them that one of their buildings might be on fire. In the end some last minute scaling down of the effect was worthwhile. The sound on the shoot was excellent, though it comes across less well and was generally too quiet in the recording, compared to the roaring of trains passing overhead, and the depot workers unloading a massive digger off a low-loader nearby.<br/><br/>If you're wondering how that activity did not appear in my usual walk-towards and walk-away shots, it's because I did those on the previous day. I did all the setup, switched on, and found that the units did not turn. I had broken something while fiddling with the octave sweeps.</div>

It also demonstrates how chronic noise pollution can be ameliorated, here forming an integral part of an ambient music piece.<br/><br/>I was very anxious about this shoot. CCTV camera pods every 50 paces, drunks yelling from one end to the other, generally being in the way of people and fast cyclists. Least of all was that the alarm, which I had recorded and set the Randomatones to play in their key, would have stopped or changed to something in the wrong key. My worst fear was one of the supports coming off and the unit falling on someone's head. That’s assuming I got the supports the right length. Too short and I would not be able to hook onto the pipes, too long and people would be hitting their heads on them.<br/><br/>Nothing of the kind went wrong. The supports were perfect. The units sounded stunning and fitted perfectly with the alarm that was still sounding 10 days after I last heard it. For six blissful minutes I wondered around videoing from various angles thinking "this is beautiful."<br/><br/>Not everything went smoothly. I had tried and tested small suction cups to stick on the tiled walls for mouting my camera (phone) and my Zoom audio recorder. On the day, the cups immediately fell off, and that was without anything attached to them, luckily. Most of the still shots I did with my phone on a gooseneck stand clamped to my cycling helmet.</div>

All surfaces are concrete, including the footpath, meaning the acoustic in the middle is excellent. The railings are perfect for hanging Randomatones from, and the water right now looks only a couple of inches deep, allowing paddling around with a tripod if desired. Even the walls have graffiti, though it's hard to see as there is no lighting inside. I will need to adorn each of the rotating units with another 10W or so of LED lighting.<br/><br/>I may not use this one, as it is a car journey from where I live (South Woodford) and I believe there is a similar specimen nearer to home that I aim to check out soon.</div>

That will be the end of pacing over to shoots with just a rucksack<br/><br/>I thought I had made a mistake here, as when the new horns arrived they were clearly 100V line devices, which would have been no use. Luckily, take the back off and all you find inside is a transformer to convert the ordinary low impedance magnet/coil driver to 100V line. Simply remove this transformer and the speaker is good to go. It's also at least 0.5Kg lighter.</div>

This location, on the river Roding just north of the Redbridge roundabout in East London, is all of that, and had exactly the look I wanted. But it was far too noisy to make a meaningful video demonstrating the sonic delights of the Randomatones. Of course it would be noisy, I should have known that. The time I first considered it as a location was summer 2020, when possibly fewer people were rushing up and down the North Circular and it was quieter. I don't remember.<br/><br>Anyway I'm reasonably pleased with the look of this video, if the sound does have to come direct from the units, and not from microphones that just picked up traffic noise. I think I need bigger units. Once again these looked tiny in their vast concrete arena. But they are still fun to capture close-up, and I risk boring even myself if I follow through with plans for several more videos like this.</div>

I knew this was a risk, and spent some time tuning the motors so that each of the discrete speeds the motors ran was in tune and in key with the notes from the Randomatones. The motors are driven from a pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi (via a couple of power transistors), and I achieved the tuning by selecting the appropriate width and pulse of the PWM. This sounded convincing indoors. Outside, all you can hear is a tuneless whining buzz like an electric shaver.<br/><br/>One of the things that attracted me to this location was the ledge on either side of the thoroughfare on which I could set up the units without being in the way of passers-by. Having only ever biked along it, I did not realise until I got there for the video that the ledge was above my head height. I insist on showing you how bad I was at climbing up onto it. I must have done so at least 12 times during the shoot. Sadly practice made no perfection, instead I got worse and worse at it.</div>

Also it had a handy ledge for me to climb up on and attach the units without a step ladder. Though I was there early in the morning, this passage was a surprisingly busy thoroughfare for dogwalkers, joggers and cyclists. Not one seemed remotely bothered that I was attaching mysterious devices to the underside of their bridge.</div>

              <div class="post-text">Back after several months away with a prototype hanging spinning Randomatone. This one has a 40 RPM geared motor whose speed is varied using one of the PWM ports on the Rasperry Pi. The motor mechanism issues its own clearly audible whine, but by using some combination of PWM voltage and frequency, I am wondering if I could tune the motor to the Randomatone notes. I want variable speed, so that several together will all rotate differently and chaotically, but I would be happy with them shifting between discrete speeds rather than varying continuously as now.<br/><br/>Also note the introduction of a cheap plastic horn speaker. Compared to the other more hi-fi cardboard cone speaker, its sound quality is poor, but the squawky mid-range of the horn does suit some of the rougher waveforms the unit generates. It's also lighter and more weatherproof than the card-cone speaker. Not that I plan to hang these from trees or lamp posts just yet.<br/><br/>I will probably rethink the decorative red and blue LEDs. It looks like a kind of weird megaphone, but when I watch the thing spinning I think of a siren on a police car or fire engine. A Sirenatone. (I doubt I will call it that for long.)</div>

I was hoping it would stay that way so that I could make a video in it with some floating Randomatones, but before I even had time to build one, all the water was pumped out and has yet to reappear.

So a couple of days later I stuffed two Randomatones into my rucksack and biked over there for a quick lunchtime installation.<br/><br/>Having done all the shots in the last video pointing at the Randomatones, in this one I hardly did any, I was so taken by the colours and geometry of this walkway. Unlike in the previous video, the positioning of the units along the ceiling line goes some way towards explaining their shape. I had planned to put one device under each tunnel section, but the ceiling was higher in the north tunnel and I found I could not reach it. At least this time I had the volume good and loud, and the units properly sang through the walkway. A lot of the ambient audio in this video was picked up by the mic on each unit.</div>

              <div class="post-text">After making a video last week of three brightly coloured Randomatones in a dreary tunnel under the North Circular, the first piece of feedback I received was "Fantastic! Did you leave them there?" No way, I thought, there's £100 of gear on each one at least! But then I thought, if this is supposed to be art, I should be aiming to do exactly that. What could I change that would make me comfortable leaving something there for, say, a day?<br/><br/>Leaving expendable stuff, is what. No Raspberry Pi/HifiBerry units, no £20 speakers (though £20 for a speaker is very cheap) and no brand new batteries. Whereupon, various bits of old junk I had in the study or the shed came to mind. I have no recollection what piece of kit this amp came from, but electronics with crazy printed circuit boards like that I reckon are from the 1970s. So, naturally, it all still worked. I soldered up some power leads where I thought the 12V supply should go, plus two speakers from an old TV (15W each, surprisingly), and a 3.5mm stereo jack to the input. Then dug out an old unloved mp3 player and plugged in. Even with those puny speakers it was pretty loud, though I know loudness in the home is on a different scale to loudness in the outdoors. This will not be a true randomatone, as it will have to play a recording. But as the real units are not yet interactive, I can load an hour of sounds on an mp3 to play in a loop, and the effect will be the same. Random ambient music for dog walkers.</div>

There is very little beauty in this perfunctory subway, but it does have a great acoustic, if you can tune out the traffic noise.

Also the yellow fluorescent hue is a let-down. While the red and orange blend seamlessly, the yellow is too much of a gradation.<br/><br/>The acoustic in this tunnel was excellent, and had the units been loud enough, and the traffic above quiet enough, the weird sounds that were still coming from the units since their Halloween update sounded entrancing in the space.

The notes arrive too slowly to clash, and there is a sense of freedom to it.<br/><br/>On the soundtrack, the bangs in the background are genuine, and I have little idea where they came from.

But in the rush to video something before the water drained away, I was ill-prepared with mics, the unit was too quiet and there was too much traffic noise.<br/><br/>Instead, what came out of this opportune shoot was a unique perspective on two semi-submerged murals of tunnel graffiti that I would normally never look at, at least not while looking where I was going. The wide-angle camera gets further away than the eye ordinarily can, and its view close to the waterline as it makes its way through the tunnel is striking. While I’m not generally a fan of spray-painting Victorian brickwork in fluorescent colours, in an ugly featureless concrete people-conduit like this, I begin to see the graffiti as modern example of the way people have been expressing themselves on walls for millennia, like 21st century cave paintings.</div>

After just about getting it working, I put on my nastiest old trainers and carried the whole thing plus my inflated inner tube down to the subway. Just as I was starting, a cyclist appeared, wondering if he could get through. I warned him I had tried yesterday and it had ended badly. He asked, is that a science experiment? No, I replied, more like an art experiment. He stayed to watch me wade a little way into the tunnel with the floating Randomatone, trying not to drop my phone in the water.<br/><br/>I learned a few things doing this: 1) The sound was not nearly loud enough to resonate in the tunnel acoustic. The volume was not set to maximum, even then I'm wondering if it would have been enough. 2) I'm glad I used polypropylene speakers, even if they were a bit small, as they caught a lot of rain. 3) Amazingly the electronics survived, despite being completely exposed, though I will not do this again without putting them in a plastic enclosure. 4) The water felt moderately warm after I'd been in it for a few minutes.</div>

Batteries lasted a good few hours despite their age, though the unit with the Model B Raspberry Pi (which consumes more power than the Model A+ versions on the other units) ran down much quicker and died. Maybe I'll need the massive golf-buggy 20Ah batteries next time, as not only are those more beefy, they are new.<br/><br/>The sound was fairly lush, though there were some technical issues with the audio not ramping up or panning properly, for which I have a plan B. Even just on the stairs there wasn't a lot of spacial definition, ie sounds that discernably come from one place or another. I realise now that the nature of the sounds, which ramp up and slowly back down in volume, probably do not lend themselves to directionality, whereas more percussive sounds might. Something to try later.<br/><br/> As a listening experience it was soothing and not at all irksome even after having it playing round the house for many hours. After turning it all off, I still heard the sounds playing in my head, like seeing residual auras of colour when the lights go out. Just as unsingable, too.</div>

I should probably be learning some fluid mechanics if I really want a go at this. My first thought was to seat the unit in an inner tube of a car tyre. I have one ready to try. However, I am still clinging to the idea of using bottles, this time facing downwards and running along the lower joists rather than perpendicular to them. Plus I have a fallback plan if I really want to make floating Randomatones, but it will involve a different frame.</div>

It will be almost impossible to capture the ambient sound distribution from having three (nevermind several) of these positioned around a room, and a normal stereo recording is going to sound too perfect an impression of the wrong thing. One idea I had is to mount a couple of tiny mics onto each unit and let each make its own room/field recording from its perspective, then mix those in the stereo image depending on where the camera is pointing.</div>

Tried a new smaller RPi (model A+) and found it had some glitches, but these could be reproduced simply by adjusting the system volume, so I'm not confident about the analogue output. Needing a replacement amp as well I went for a HifiBerry Pi "hat", which is entirely digital and will thus bypass all the RPi audio bits which I think are the issue. Also, brilliantly, it takes 12V but will do the step down to 5V itself for the RPi. This will save me having to have an extra unit with wiring issues. Tried it all out after the necessary config changes in the RPi to tell it where its audio has to go. Not only does everything work, the audio is basically clean. Needs a volume control though, without a keybaord or a mouse. Hmm! In a totally unrelated flight of consciousness, I have begun pursuing the crazy idea of making a set of these units that will float. This would be the basic chassis, and one way of making it float might be to use the inner tube of a car tyre. So I've ordered one. I might work on this frame idea a bit more. I'm pleased with my elementary woodworking skills to have made this item, which at least looks like it fits together.</div>

Anyway I tried a USB audio interface just to rule out the RPi onboard DAC. Slightly quieter. Reduced noise significantly by not using 12v-5v stepdown, instead powering the RPi from a regular mains PSU. Got noise at all running it from two separate batteries. Joining the battery grounds made a load of noise reappear. Joining the +ves also made noise appear. Tried a different 12V-5V converter from the car, same result.</div>

I've been preparing the software for this for some time now and had it working on a regular linux machine, and have tried it out on the RPi by itself over Wifi, not in this assembly yet.</div>
