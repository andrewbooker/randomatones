        "text": "Randomatones are an ongoing sonic art exploration by software developer and musician Andrew Booker. The original idea was to create ambient music using a kind of distributed looping process that removed all regularity of rhythm and timing. The technique of applying a slow attack to sampled sounds and playing them at random points in time is entirely suited for creating ambient music. During initial development, the idea digressed from the playing of samples to having the units generate their own sounds. One principle that has remained during their evolution is that the devices should be visible, obviously identifiable as the sources of the sound, and somewhat interesting to look at. Another is that they are ideally used in places with good natural reverb."

        "text": "Andrew Booker is a professional software developer and has been an amateur musician since his teens, producing his first self-financed solo mini-album in the 1990s. As a prog drummer, over the past two decades he has recorded, or at least performed, with No-man, Tim Bowness, Sanguine Hum, Rain and Beatrix Players, appearing live in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and USA. Also he has played on and produced recordings with Peter Banks (ex Yes) and David Cross (ex King Crimson). From 2007-2010 Andrew ran Improvizone, a semi-regular improvisation evening playing ambient electronic chillout music. Improvizone has occasionally resurfaced since then, and for an appearance in 2019 Andrew put together a software-based randomising voice sample player, automated so as not to require free hands to play it. He later developed this technology into the Randomatones, his main artistic activity since 2020. Most recently, when not paddling into canal tunnels to shoot Randomatones videos, Andrew can be found playing large Brazilian and Italian tambourines and singing in a (mainly) covers trio, gigging within easy reach of North East London."
