          <div class="post-text">Painted first versions, pictured here on the stairs up to my study at home in South Woodford. I built three units, and most of the components (Raspberry Pi, HifiBerry, speakers) were new. The batteries are old pairs of 6V lead-acid types I had left over from my shed, though I had orginally bought larger batteries for two of them. I never took these out of the house, and made only one video of them, in which I introduced them. I have since stripped them of their components for re-use in other units, and only two of the three frames remain.</div>

          <div class="post-text">The first floating version, built around a wooden frame comprising two corner sides of a cube. I built only one of these, a fourth unit alongside the three other white standing versions, with a new smaller lead acid battery. It had an onboard camera and zoom audio recorder, plus a pump below the water level to provide rotation. I barely had time to test it before taking it down to a flooded subway at the bottom of my road. It didn't work very well, was very quiet and did not record its own audio. But to the extent that you could hear it, it sounded and looked very promising.</div>

          <div class="post-text">Having built these especially to go in a foot tunnel under the Central Line in Snaresbrook, I tried them out at a couple of other locations first, starting with a tunnel under the A406 in Walthamstow Forest, pictured here. I took the standing frames apart in order to build these, using new smaller lead acid batteries of the same kind as the floating unit. I had grand plans to make them remote-controllable, but gave up after failing to get them to connect to a wifi hub reliably, and make them work on a timer basis instead, giving me five minutes to get cameras in position and get some intial shots, and then five minutes of sound.<br /><br/>To date they are the last time I videoed three of a version. I painted them in striking fluorescent colours to make them stand out in a video, and introduced electret microphones on each to record the ambient sound. With no noisy rotation on the devices, they did a reasonable job, and the ambient recordings from Aldersbrook and Snaresbrook were excellent. Strapped onto handrailings in this picture, they were clearly visible both from the footway and on video, whereas in the location for which they were intended, and where they sounded best, they were too inconspicuous for my liking. After Snaresbook, I left them alone for months, then eventually took them to bits and re-used all the components. I still have the original frames.</div>

          <div class="post-text">When I finally did take the A-frames to bits, it was to build these. I had always wanted rotating Randomatones, but had only cursorally managed it in the first floating version, and even then only for the first few minutes. On a bike ride into town one autumn morning I discovered a suitable spot for a shoot, under a railway bridge in Walthamstow Marshes, and built these spinning units especially for it, even down to the shackle bolt fixings at the top of the low-RPM motor spindles, for clamping to the I-beams under the bridge. Having made a shoot the previous year in Aldersbrook, biking there from my house with just two of the A-frames, I made only two of these, such that I could get them both in my rucksack and bike to various locations within reach of home. I ended up making six videos with these units, including this fantastic shoot in the Woolwich Foot Tunnel.</div>

          <div class="post-text">Although the spinning units were small and easily portable, I was starting to venture into places where they were too small for the space. I began building two larger ones, on basically the same principle, but with a larger cone speaker and a much larger horn speaker, making new orange and pink frames. I finished this orange-framed one first, and took it on a shoot outside Southampton with the smaller blue version, having to carry it in its own bag it was so much larger. By that point, having made a few good waterside shoots, I was becoming impatient to build some proper floating versions. I never completed the second large pink spinning unit, but left this orange unit assembled while I canibalised the two smaller ones for new floating versions.</div>

          <div class="post-text">In a radical change of approach, I fitted the standard Randomatone components, with larger horns, to two new structures that sat on inflatable swim rings. Each had a propellor underneath to make it rotate, and the blue "pilot" unit had an additional propellor that could turn on a vertical servo-driven post to provide some steerable movement. The propellor and battery were on a separate detachable section that slid on and off, with connection to the main body via serial plugs. To make these usable in a shoot, I had to get the wifi remote control properly working, for both the sound and the propellor control, and discovered that one of my action cameras served as a decent Wifi hub that the units seemed to connect to reliably. I tried them out at this location under the Kingsland Bridge at Limehouse lock. There was a good breeze, the steering propellor was completely under-powered and for a moment I thought I would lose them in the weeds on the opposite inaccessible side of the canal. Some how I got them back, ending a very short shoot, and replaced the steering mechanism in time for their next shoot under the former Birlec factory in Birmingham.</div>

          <div class="post-text">Mindful that the original Randomatones were three in number, I built a third floating unit in the new design, painted fluorescent pink to go with the blue and orange units. I had intended, and might still one day, take all three on a shoot, but I have yet to do so. Instead I have mostly paired the blue pilot unit with this new pink device, in a total of 13 videos to date. Their design barely changed over that time. I started with an underwater camera on the battery block. The first time I used it, the water was too murky for any of the footage to be usable. I didn't bother with in on the second shoot, but left the attachment on. The attachment (a small metal bracket) was still on for the third shoot, and it tore the float as I was pulling the whole thing out of the water. I've still never magange to get any underwater footage, despite having had a couple of perfect opportunities.</div>

          <div class="post-text">After many location shoots in deserted tunnels or other generally obscure places, I felt it was time to bring the Randomatones to an audience, and revisit an intial idea of exhibiting them somehow. I had an offer to use them as part of a show in nearby Highams Park, and within a few days had separate offer for a different show in Cambridge with my old Improvizone friends, and used these as a driver to build new standing units. I wanted the rotation capability still, so I put together a couple of turntable-like setups using some lazy-suzan bearing joints and the low RPM motors reclaimed from the original spinning units. The bearing joints are noisy and unreliable, either coming loose or seizing entirely, but essentially work.<br/><br/>I was in the middle of building new smaller floating units, with different speaker setups, comprising pairs of the small horns I used for the original spinning units, plus some new waterproof cone speakers purchased especially after my experiences in canal tunnels. I added some bright new LEDs (immediately blowing a couple after wiring them incorrectly) and some opaque cylinders intended to bring some directionality to the cone speakers, but that actually make very good lampshade-like baffles for the LEDs.</div>
